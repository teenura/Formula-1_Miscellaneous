1. Can the dirty air problem be solved?

Formula 1 since its inception had its fair share of core issues. But since the introduction of 'ground effects' cars that leverage flowing air to generate downforce and hence grip, constructors have tried a wide array of aero elements on the car to attain optimum downforce. This makes the cars significantly fast around corners while losing an insignificant amount of straight line speed.                                                                                                                  But these appendages need laminar air flow to function and leaves a wake of turbulent air. Thus any trailing car, once it gets close enough to the leader, even if it has pace advantage will not be able to overtake the leader. This makes the sport a little pointless. So the governing body, FIA has been fiddling with regulations since the early 2000s to enable better racing.

a. One of the first major regulation change came in 2009, that banned all aero elemts except front and rear wing. But all teams could not adapt equally and some teams even found loopholes in the regulations to continue using barge boards that made racs even less competitive. This can be seen in the graph provided below where number of overtakes in 2009 is actually less than 2008.

b. As we can see number of overtakes was also amost similar in 2010. Even after an year of developement, things just didn't get competitive. So in 2011 FIA wanted to manually intervene and brought forth the Drag Reduction System(DRS) that allowed the trailing car to reduce drag on some specific straights marked as DRS zones giving them a 15Km/hr pace advantage thus facilitating an overtake. This worked as we can see number of overtakes jumped by 72% in 2011 compared to 2010.

c. Next major regulation came in 2014 when 2.4lt V8 engines were replaaced with a hybrid 1.6lt V6 turbo. But this was followed by a drop in overtakes again to pre DRS levels. The cause for that and the one-off sharp increase in overtakes in 2016 needs to be analysed further.

d. In 2022 dramatic changes in regulations have been made to clean up the air generated by the cars including using of Venturi tunnel and high set diffusers. This has  solely been introduced to promote more wheel to wheel racing. We are currently 3 races into the season. Let us observe the stats compared to previous years.

As we can see overtakes has improved by a very small margin for Jeddah and Bahrain, and by almost 60% for Albert Park circuit. However more data is needed to dtermine whether the new regulations have finally managed to solve this problem.


   2.   Next we analyse which kinds of track promote better racing. For that we are using the metric, overtakes per race over all races at any particular track. It is obvious that street circuits promote less close racing. While circuits like Suzuka average at 240 overtakes per race, street circuits like Jeddah averages about 95. But why, some track focused circuits are better suited to overtakes than others can only be answered by analying track design and drs zones.

To get lap by lap insights, 2021 races have beem traced using deltas of each driver per lap from mean lap time. The gap betwwen anyy two lines is the actual distance betwwen drivers in a race. Intersection of any of the two lines means an overtake had taken place. The spread of the lines can be interpreted as actual field sprea during the race. 
Let us compare two extremities in terms of overtakes per race, Jeddah and Bahrain.
